Bachelor thesis project - Visualization of open data published according to the Formal Open Standard for public administration bulletin boards

### Abstract

The Bachelor thesis is about the design and implementation of a web application which visualizes data from public administration bulletin boards. It uses open data published according to a new machine-readable format specified as a Formal Open Standard.

The application is intended not only for users from the general public, who can use it to search and filter information from bulletin boards, but also for data publishers. The application performs validation of published data and clearly displays any deficiencies.

To retrieve data the application uses SPARQL endpoints of the [National Data Catalog](https://data.gov.cz/english/) and the [Register of rights and obligations](https://www.szrcr.cz/cs/registr-prav-a-povinnosti). It is implemented as a single-page application in TypeScript using React framework.
